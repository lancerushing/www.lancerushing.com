                    <li><h2>Final Agreement</h2>
                        <p>This Agreement, together with all modifications, constitutes the complete and exclusive
                            agreement between
                            You and Us, and supersede and govern all prior proposals, agreements, or other
                            communications. This
                            Agreement may not be amended or modified by You except by means of a written document signed
                            by both You
                            and an authorized representative of Us. By applying for Lance Rushing’s services through the
                            online
                            application process or otherwise, or by using the Services under this Agreement, you
                            acknowledge that
                            you have read and agree to be bound by all terms and conditions of this Agreement and
                            documents
                            incorporated by reference.</p></li>

                    <li><h2>Enforceability</h2>
                        <p>In the event that any provision of this Agreement shall be unenforceable or invalid under any
                            applicable
                            law or be so held by applicable court decision, such unenforceability or invalidity shall
                            not render
                            this Agreement unenforceable or invalid as a whole. We will amend or replace such provision
                            with one
                            that is valid and enforceable and which achieves, to the extent possible, our original
                            objectives and
                            intent as reflected in the original provision.</p></li>
                    <li><h2>Assignment and Resale</h2>
                        <p>Except as otherwise set forth herein, Your rights under this Agreement are not assignable or
                            transferable. Any attempt by Your creditors to obtain an interest in Your rights under this
                            Agreement,
                            whether by attachment, levy, garnishment or otherwise, renders this Agreement voidable at
                            Our option.
                            You agree not to reproduce, duplicate, copy, sell, resell or otherwise exploit for any
                            commercial
                            purposes any of the Services (or portion thereof) without Lance Rushing's prior express
                            written consent.</p>

                            responsible for,
                            any cessation, interruption or delay in the performance of its obligations hereunder due to

                            breaches, or delays; or any law, order regulation, direction, action or request of the
                            government,
                            including any federal, state and local governments having or claiming jurisdiction over
                            Lance Rushing, or of

                            affected party,
                            provided that the party relying upon this section (i) shall have given the other party
                            written notice
                            thereof promptly and, in any event, within five (5) days of discovery thereof and (ii) shall
                            take all
                            steps reasonably necessary under the circumstances to mitigate the effects of the force
                            majeure event
                            upon which such notice is based; provided further, that in the event a force majeure event
                            described in
                            this Section extends for a period in excess of thirty (30) days in the aggregate, Lance
                            Rushing may
                            immediately terminate this Agreement.</p></li>
