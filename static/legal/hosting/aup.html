                    You can use this tool to back up Your files. If loss of data occurs due to an error of Lance Rushing, We
                    will attempt to recover the data for no charge to the client. If data loss occurs due to negligence
                    of a client in securing their account or by an action of the client, Lance Rushing will attempt to
                    recover the data from the most recent archive for a $15.00.</p></li>
